My Favorite Season

My favorite season is spring because everything comes alive again after months of quiet winter days. When the snow melts and puddles shine in the afternoon sun, the whole neighborhood seems to wake up at once. Crocuses poke through the soil, neighbors open their windows to let in fresh breezes, and the air smells like rain and pine needles. On the walk to school I notice cardinals and robins returning from their long journeys, and I feel a little thrill each time I hear their bright songs echoing between the houses.

Spring is also the time when my family spends the most hours outdoors together. We plan weekend bike rides along the river trail, and we keep a picnic blanket in the car in case we discover a new park we want to explore. My younger brother and I organize kickball games with friends, and we stay outside until the setting sun paints orange stripes across the sky. Even chores feel enjoyable; raking last year’s leaves makes room for new grass, and watering young plants turns into an excuse to spray each other with the hose.

In our backyard garden, spring feels like a magical workshop. We line seed packets on the patio table, choosing the perfect spots for peas, lettuce, and bright marigolds. Each evening we check whether tiny sprouts have appeared, and we celebrate the moment the first tomato blossoms open. I keep a notebook where I sketch the changes I notice: the way bean vines curl around a trellis, the buzzing visitors that help pollinate each flower, and the robin that builds a nest on our fence. Observing this slow and steady growth teaches me patience and curiosity.

Springtime at school is just as exciting. Teachers schedule field trips to nature centers, and we measure the temperature of stream water for science class. Our music program moves outdoors, so we rehearse under blooming cherry trees while petals swirl around our feet. Field Day arrives with relay races, tug-of-war matches, and cheers from classmates on the sidelines. As we count down to summer vacation, we also take time to appreciate the new skills we have learned throughout the year. For all of these reasons, spring will always be my favorite season: it promises fresh beginnings, brings people together, and fills each day with discoveries waiting to bloom.
