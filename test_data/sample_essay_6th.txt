My Favorite Season

My favorite season is spring because everything comes alive again. In spring, the weather gets warmer and the days get longer. I love seeing flowers bloom in gardens and parks. The trees start to grow new leaves that are bright green. Birds return from their winter homes and sing beautiful songs in the morning.

Spring is a great time to be outside. I enjoy playing sports with my friends after school. We can ride bikes and play games in the park. Sometimes we have picnics with our families. The fresh air feels good after the cold winter months.

In spring, animals wake up from hibernation. I like watching squirrels run around and birds build nests. My family plants a garden with vegetables and flowers. We water the plants every day and watch them grow. It's exciting to see the first tomatoes and flowers appear.

Spring also means the end of the school year is coming. I look forward to summer vacation and spending time with friends. But I also enjoy the spring activities at school like field trips and outdoor games. Spring is definitely my favorite time of year because it brings new life and new opportunities for fun.
