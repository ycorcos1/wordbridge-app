Why Video Games Can Be Educational

A lot of adults think video games are just a waste of time but I disagree. Video games can actually teach you alot of important skills if you play the right ones. In this essay I'm going to explain three ways that video games are educational.

First of all, video games teach problem solving. When your playing a game like Minecraft or Portal, you have to figure out puzzles and challenges. You cant just give up when something is hard, you have to keep trying different strategies until you find one that works. This is the same kind of thinking we use in math class when we solve word problems. My dad says that when he plays video games with me, he can see me thinking through the problems step by step.

Second, video games improve hand-eye coordination and reflexes. Games like Rocket League or any sports game require you to react quickly and make split-second decisions. Studies have shown that surgeons who play video games are actually better at doing operations because their hands are more steady and they can react faster. This proves that the skills you learn in video games can transfer to real life.

Third, many video games teach you about history and science. For example, Assassins Creed games are set in real historical time periods like Ancient Egypt or the Renaissance. While the main story is fictional, the cities and buildings are based on real places and the game teaches you facts about that time period. I learned more about Ancient Greece from playing Assassins Creed Odyssey than I did from my textbook.

Some people say that video games make kids violent or lazy, but I think that's only true if you play too much or play the wrong kinds of games. Everything in moderation is important. I only play for an hour on weekdays and maybe two hours on weekends, and I make sure to play games that make me think.

In conclusion, video games can definitely be educational if you choose good ones and dont play too much. They teach problem solving, improve coordination, and can even teach you about history and science. Parents and teachers should recognize that not all screen time is bad, and video games can actually help kids learn important skills for the future.
