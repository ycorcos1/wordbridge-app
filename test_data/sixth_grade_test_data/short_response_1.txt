My Favorite Book and Why I Love It

My favorite book is "Wonder" by R.J. Palacio. I read it last year and it really made me think about how we treat people who are different. The main character is a boy named Auggie who has a facial deformity, and the book is about his first year going to a regular school instead of being homeschooled.

What I like most about this book is how it shows different perspectives. Each section is told by a different character, so you get to see what everyone is thinking and feeling. This really helped me understand that everyone has their own side of the story. Sometimes people do mean things not because they're bad people, but because they're scared or confused.

The part that made me cry was when Auggie's dog Daisy died. It was already hard for Auggie at school, and then this happened too. But I also loved the ending when he got the special award at the graduation ceremony. It showed that being kind and brave is more important than being popular.

Reading "Wonder" changed how I think about people. Now when I see someone who looks different or acts different, I try to be more understanding. The book taught me that everyone is fighting their own battles, and we should choose to be kind. That's why Mr. Browne's precepts are so important. My favorite one is "When given the choice between being right and being kind, choose kind."

I think every sixth grader should read this book because it teaches important lessons about friendship, acceptance, and standing up for what's right. It's also really easy to read and keeps you interested the whole time. The chapters are short which makes it perfect for reading before bed. I've already read it three times and I still notice new things each time.

This book inspired me to start a kindness club at my school. We do random acts of kindness and try to include people who seem lonely. I hope that by doing this, we can make our school more like the kind of place Auggie deserved to have from the beginning.
