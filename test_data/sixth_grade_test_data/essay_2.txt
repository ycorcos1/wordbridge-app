Should Schools Have Longer Recess?

I think schools should definately have longer recess periods. Right now we only get 20 minutes of recess and by the time we get outside and find our friends its almost time to go back in. In this essay im going to give several reasons why longer recess would be good for students and even help us do better in school.

My first reason is that kids need more physical activity. Everyone knows that childhood obesity is a big problem in America. The CDC says that about 1 in 5 kids are obese which can lead to serious health problems like diabetes and heart disease. If we had longer recess we would have more time to run around, play sports, and get exercise. Right now 20 minutes isnt enough time to really get your heart rate up and burn calories. If recess was 45 minutes or even an hour, kids would be much more active and healthy.

PE class is not enough by itself. We only have PE twice a week and the rest of the days we just sit in classrooms all day. Our bodies are not designed to sit still for 6 hours straight. When I have to sit for too long I get really fidgety and have trouble paying attention. But after recess I always feel more awake and ready to learn. Scientists have done studies that show physical activity actually helps your brain work better. So longer recess would help us be better students not worse ones.

My second reason is that recess helps with social skills and friendship. During recess is when we get to interact with kids from other classes and make new friends. We learn important skills like how to share, how to resolve conflicts, and how to work together as a team. These are skills that are just as important as math and reading but you cant learn them from a textbook.

When we play games during recess we have to negociate rules, take turns, and sometimes deal with disagreements. This is practice for real life. If someone is being unfair or mean, we have to figure out how to handle it ourselves without a teacher telling us what to do every second. This builds independence and problem solving skills.

Some kids are shy in the classroom but they come alive during recess. My friend Tyler barely talks in class but during recess hes really funny and good at organizing games. Recess gives kids like him a chance to shine and show different parts of there personality. If we had longer recess more kids would have opportunities to build confidence and leadership skills.

My third reason is that recess gives kids a mental break which actually improves learning. Have you ever tried to focus on something for hours and hours without a break? Its really hard! Your mind starts to wander and you cant absorb information as well. Teachers are always telling us to take breaks when we study at home so why dont they give us enough breaks at school?

Research shows that the brain needs downtime to process and remember information. When we play during recess our brain is actually organizing all the stuff we learned in the morning. Then when we come back to class we have a fresh start and can focus better. Countries like Finland have longer and more frequent recess breaks and they have some of the best test scores in the world. This proves that more recess doesnt hurt academic performance it actually helps.

Also recess reduces stress and improves mood. School can be really stressful with tests, homework, and trying to fit in socially. Recess is the one time during the day when we can just relax and have fun. Playing and laughing with friends releases endorphins which are chemicals that make you feel happy. When kids are less stressed and happier they behave better in class and are more motivated to learn.

Some people argue that longer recess would take away time from important subjects like math and reading. They think we need every minute of class time to prepare for standardized tests. But I think this argument is wrong for several reasons.

First like I already explained recess actually helps us learn better so we would make better use of our class time. Quality is more important than quantity. Its better to have 5 hours of focused learning than 7 hours where kids are zoned out and not paying attention.

Second not everything important can be measured on a standardized test. The social skills, physical health, and emotional well-being that we develop during recess are just as important as academic skills. Schools should be preparing us for life not just for tests.

Third many other countries that do better than us on international tests have longer recess periods. So clearly more recess doesnt hurt academic achievement. Maybe we should learn from there example instead of ignoring it.

Another argument against longer recess is that some kids get bullied during recess and having more recess would mean more opportunities for bullying. While bullying is definitely a serious problem I dont think the solution is to take away recess. That would be punishing everyone for the actions of a few bullies. Instead schools should have better supervision during recess and stronger anti-bullying programs. We shouldnt eliminate something good just because some people misuse it.

Finally some people say that longer recess would be hard to schedule and supervise. Schools would need more playground monitors and it would disrupt the daily schedule. While these are legitimate concerns I think they can be solved with good planning. Schools could hire more staff or ask parent volunteers to help supervise. As for scheduling schools manage to schedule everything else like lunch, assemblies, and special classes so they can figure out how to schedule longer recess too.

In conclusion I strongly believe that schools should extend recess to at least 45 minutes per day. The benefits for physical health, social development, and academic performance far outway any drawbacks. Kids are not robots that can sit still and absorb information for hours on end. We need time to move, play, and recharge. If schools really want to help students succeed they should recognize that recess is not a waste of time its an essential part of education. I hope that principals and school boards will consider the research and listen to students when making decisions about recess. After all we're the ones who have to live with these policies every day so our voices should matter. Longer recess would make school a healthier and more effective place for learning and I think most students and even teachers would agree with me.
