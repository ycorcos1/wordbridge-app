Classroom Discussion Transcript: "Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief" by Rick Riordan

Teacher: Hey Jamie, come on in! I wanted to talk with you about the Percy Jackson book.

Jamie: Okay. Um, did I do something wrong?

Teacher: No, not at all! I just noticed you seemed really into it during silent reading time, and I wanted to hear your thoughts. Did you finish it?

Jamie: Yeah I finished it. It was really cool.

Teacher: What did you like about it?

Jamie: I don't know. The action scenes were good. Like when Percy fought the Minotaur.

Teacher: The Minotaur battle was exciting! That happens pretty early in the book, right? What surprised you about that scene?

Jamie: Well, I didn't think he could actually beat it because he just found out he was a demigod. He didn't know how to fight or anything.

Teacher: True, he was very inexperienced. How did he manage to win?

Jamie: He just kind of... did it? He grabbed the horn and stabbed the Minotaur with it.

Teacher: Right. Do you think that says anything about Percy's character? That he could defeat a monster without any training?

Jamie: Maybe he's naturally good at fighting because his dad is Poseidon?

Teacher: That's possible. The book suggests that demigods inherit some abilities from their godly parents. What else happens in the story after that?

Jamie: He goes to Camp Half-Blood and meets Annabeth and Grover. Well, he already knew Grover but he didn't know Grover was a satyr.

Teacher: How did Percy feel about discovering his best friend had been lying to him?

Jamie: Um... I think he was okay with it? He was more worried about his mom.

Teacher: Yes, his mother being taken by Hades was a major motivation for Percy. What quest does he end up going on?

Jamie: He has to find Zeus's lightning bolt before the summer solstice or there's going to be a war between the gods.

Teacher: Exactly. That's a lot of pressure for a 12-year-old! If you were Percy, would you have taken on that quest?

Jamie: I mean... probably not? It sounds really dangerous. But he didn't have a choice because they thought he stole it.

Teacher: Good point. He was accused of the theft even though he didn't do it. That must have been frustrating.

Jamie: Yeah and nobody believed him at first except his friends.

Teacher: Speaking of his friends, what did you think about the friendship between Percy, Annabeth, and Grover?

Jamie: They worked together pretty good. Grover was kinda scared a lot but he still helped. And Annabeth was really smart.

Teacher: Yes, they each brought different strengths to the team. Can you give me an example of how their different skills helped them?

Jamie: Um... Annabeth's good at strategy and figuring things out. Like with Medusa, she knew not to look at her. And Grover can sense monsters.

Teacher: Perfect examples! What about Percy - what did he contribute to the group?

Jamie: He's brave and good at fighting. Oh and he can control water because of his dad.

Teacher: Right! There were several times when his water powers came in handy. Which one stood out to you most?

Jamie: Probably when they were at the Arch in St. Louis and it exploded and he fell into the water but didn't die.

Teacher: That was dramatic! The book has a lot of adventures as they travel west. Which one was your favorite?

Jamie: Maybe the Lotus Casino? That was weird how time worked different there.

Teacher: Very weird. Why do you think Rick Riordan included that episode?

Jamie: I don't know... to make them almost run out of time?

Teacher: That's part of it - it raised the stakes. But what were the lotus flowers doing to people in the casino?

Jamie: Making them forget about everything and just want to stay there and play games forever.

Teacher: Exactly. Do you think that might be a metaphor for anything in real life?

Jamie: Like... video games? Or phones? Stuff that's fun but makes you waste time?

Teacher: That's a great connection! Distractions that seem harmless but trap you. Let's talk about the ending. Were you surprised when you found out who really stole the lightning bolt?

Jamie: Yeah! I thought it was Hades the whole time but it was actually Luke.

Teacher: Why do you think Luke did it?

Jamie: Because he was mad at his dad for not paying attention to him.

Teacher: His father is Hermes, right? How did Luke's relationship with his father influence his choices?

Jamie: He felt like the gods don't care about their kids. So he wanted to get revenge by helping Kronos.

Teacher: That's a pretty serious betrayal. Did you understand Luke's motivation even if you didn't agree with his actions?

Jamie: I guess. It would be sad if your parent just ignored you. But he still shouldn't have tried to kill Percy.

Teacher: True. The book explores this theme of parental relationships a lot. How would you describe Percy's relationship with Poseidon?

Jamie: They don't really talk much because Poseidon can't really be around Percy. But Percy knows his dad cares about him.

Teacher: What makes Percy believe his father cares?

Jamie: Well Poseidon sent him that gift at the end. And he healed Percy in the water that one time.

Teacher: Those small acts meant a lot to Percy. Now, what about Sally, Percy's mom? What did you think of her?

Jamie: She's nice. She really loves Percy and protects him.

Teacher: She made a big sacrifice to protect him, didn't she? She stayed with Gabe for years because his smell hid Percy from monsters.

Jamie: Yeah, Gabe was disgusting. I'm glad she turned him into a statue at the end.

Teacher: That was satisfying! Sally proved she was braver and stronger than people realized. Let's shift to talking about the Greek mythology. Had you learned about Greek myths before reading this book?

Jamie: A little bit in third grade. We read some stories about Hercules and stuff.

Teacher: Did this book make you more interested in Greek mythology?

Jamie: Yeah, it's cool how it mixes the old myths with modern stuff like they're in New York and Las Vegas.

Teacher: That's one of the clever things about Riordan's writing. He makes ancient mythology feel relevant today. Did any of the gods or monsters surprise you?

Jamie: Ares was different than I thought. I didn't think a god would be so mean and violent.

Teacher: Ares is the god of war, so violence is kind of his thing. But you're right that he wasn't heroic. The book shows that gods have flaws just like humans.

Jamie: Yeah, and they fight with each other a lot. Zeus and Poseidon were about to start a war over the lightning bolt.

Teacher: The gods' conflicts mirror human conflicts, don't they? Pride, jealousy, misunderstandings - these cause problems whether you're a god or a mortal.

Jamie: I guess that's true.

Teacher: One more question - do you think Percy will have more adventures? The book is part of a series.

Jamie: Oh yeah, definitely. Kronos is still trying to come back and Luke is still out there. Plus Percy has to do more quests probably.

Teacher: There are actually four more books in the series if you want to continue! But before you rush off to read those, I want to ask what you think was the most important lesson Percy learned in this book?

Jamie: Maybe that he's not alone? At the beginning he thought he was just a loser kid who had problems, but then he found out he's actually special and has friends who care about him.

Teacher: That's beautiful, Jamie. And I think that's something every reader can relate to - feeling like you don't belong until you find your people.

Jamie: Yeah.

Teacher: Well, I really enjoyed hearing your thoughts! You clearly paid attention to the story and thought about what it means. Keep up the great reading!

Jamie: Thanks. Can I really read the next ones?

Teacher: Absolutely! Come see me and I'll help you get the second book. It's called "The Sea of Monsters."

Jamie: Cool!
