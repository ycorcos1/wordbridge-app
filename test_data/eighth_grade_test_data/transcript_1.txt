Classroom Discussion Transcript: "1984" by George Orwell

Teacher: Good afternoon, Morgan. I've been eager to discuss "1984" with you. This is a challenging and disturbing novel—how did you find it?

Morgan: Honestly, it was really unsettling. I kept thinking about how some of the things in the book aren't that different from things happening today, which made it even more disturbing.

Teacher: That's a common and valid response. Orwell wrote the novel in 1948, but its warnings feel remarkably contemporary. Let's start with the world Orwell creates. How would you describe Oceania and the Party's control?

Morgan: It's totalitarian in the most extreme sense. The Party doesn't just control people's actions—it controls their thoughts, their language, even their memories of the past. Big Brother is always watching through telescreens, the Thought Police arrest people for thoughtcrime, and they've literally rewritten history to support whatever the Party claims at any given moment.

Teacher: Excellent summary. The comprehensiveness of that control is key. Let's discuss some of the specific mechanisms of control. What is Newspeak and what purpose does it serve?

Morgan: Newspeak is the language the Party is creating to replace Oldspeak—what we'd call normal English. The goal is to make certain thoughts literally unthinkable by removing the words needed to express them. If there's no word for "freedom" or "rebellion," the theory goes, people can't conceive of those ideas. It's not just censorship—it's trying to eliminate the cognitive capacity for dissent.

Teacher: Precisely. The appendix on Newspeak is fascinating because it's written in past tense, suggesting Oceania eventually fell, though we don't see that in the novel. What did you think about the idea that controlling language could control thought?

Morgan: I think there's something to it, though probably not as completely as the Party hopes. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which we learned about in psychology, suggests language does influence thought. If you don't have words for concepts, it's harder to think about them clearly. But humans are creative—we find ways to express ideas even with limited language. Still, restricting vocabulary definitely makes complex thought more difficult.

Teacher: Good connection to linguistics. Let's talk about the Ministry of Truth, where Winston works. What's ironic about the ministries' names?

Morgan: They're all inverted—the Ministry of Truth spreads lies and rewrites history, the Ministry of Peace wages war, the Ministry of Love tortures people, and the Ministry of Plenty creates scarcity. It's doublethink in practice. The names say one thing while the reality is the opposite, and citizens are expected to accept both simultaneously.

Teacher: Yes, and that brings us to doublethink itself. Can you explain that concept?

Morgan: Doublethink is holding two contradictory beliefs simultaneously and accepting both. Like "War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength"—these are contradictions, but Party members are trained to believe them both. Or when the Party changes who they're at war with from Eastasia to Eurasia, everyone has to believe they've always been at war with Eurasia, even though they remember it being Eastasia. You have to remember and forget at the same time.

Teacher: Orwell presents doublethink as essential to the Party's power. Why is that?

Morgan: Because it destroys objective truth. If you can make people believe contradictions, if you can control their memories and perceptions of reality, then there's no stable ground for resistance. Winston's rebellion starts with asserting objective truth—"Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makes four"—because that's something the Party can't change. Except, as we see later, they can make him believe two plus two equals five through torture.

Teacher: That mathematical example is powerful because it seems like the most objective, unchallengeable truth. Yet under sufficient pressure, even that crumbles. Let's discuss Winston himself. How would you characterize him as a protagonist?

Morgan: He's not a traditional hero. He's middle-aged, out of shape, has varicose veins, and is ultimately weak. He starts the novel with small rebellions—keeping a diary, buying the paperweight, renting the room—but these are all private acts. He fantasizes about rebellion but doesn't have the courage or means to actually fight the Party. He's an everyman figure, which makes his fate more tragic because he's relatable.

Teacher: His ordinariness is important. He's not exceptional, which means what happens to him could happen to anyone. What motivates his initial rebellion?

Morgan: Partly intellectual—he wants to know the truth about the past and assert objective reality. Partly emotional—he's lonely and alienated, and his affair with Julia offers connection and pleasure in a joyless world. But I think it's also just residual humanity asserting itself. He has these memories of life before the Party, these instincts that what he's experiencing is wrong, even though he's been conditioned to accept it.

Teacher: Well said. Let's talk about Julia. How does her approach to rebellion differ from Winston's?

Morgan: Julia is more pragmatic and less ideological. She doesn't care about the past or about overthrowing the Party—she just wants to carve out private spaces for pleasure and authentic feeling. She rebels through personal gratification, through living as much as possible in the present moment. Winston is obsessed with understanding the system and hoping for eventual change; Julia just wants to enjoy what she can while she can.

Teacher: Some readers view Julia as shallow compared to Winston. Do you agree?

Morgan: I don't think she's shallow—I think she's realistic. She understands that the Party is probably invincible and that grand revolutionary dreams are futile. Her rebellion is about maintaining her humanity through pleasure and connection, which is its own form of resistance. In some ways, she's more subversive than Winston because she's found a way to psychologically survive that doesn't depend on false hope.

Teacher: That's a nuanced reading. Though of course, neither approach ultimately succeeds. Let's discuss O'Brien. What did you make of him?

Morgan: O'Brien is terrifying because he represents intelligent evil. He's not a mindless fanatic—he fully understands what the Party is doing and embraces it consciously. When he tortures Winston in the Ministry of Love, he explains the Party's motivations with chilling clarity. The Party doesn't seek power as a means to some other end—power is the end itself. "If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—forever."

Teacher: That quote is one of the novel's most haunting. O'Brien tells Winston that the Party seeks power for its own sake, that they don't even pretend to be working toward a utopian future. How does this differ from how totalitarian regimes typically justify themselves?

Morgan: Most authoritarian governments claim they're working toward some greater good—building the perfect society, protecting the nation, serving God, whatever. The Party dispenses with such justifications. O'Brien admits they control people simply because they can, because they want to. It's pure domination as an end in itself. In some ways, that's more honest than other tyrannies, but it's also more nihilistic and hopeless.

Teacher: Yes, there's no redemption possible, no way to convince them they're wrong because they don't claim to be right in any moral sense. Let's talk about the torture scenes in Part Three. They're difficult to read. What is the Party trying to achieve through Winston's torture?

Morgan: They're not just trying to make him obey—they want to remake his mind completely. O'Brien says they don't kill heretics, they convert them. They want Winston to genuinely believe that two plus two equals five, to genuinely love Big Brother. It's not enough that he complies out of fear; they want to destroy his inner life, his capacity for independent thought. They want total control over his consciousness.

Teacher: That distinction between external compliance and internal transformation is crucial. Why does the Party care about Winston's inner thoughts if he's already powerless?

Morgan: I think it's about the principle. If even one person maintains inner resistance, maintains a private self that the Party can't penetrate, then the Party's power isn't absolute. They need total control to maintain their reality. Plus, O'Brien seems to take personal satisfaction in breaking Winston—there's sadism in it, the pleasure of domination.

Teacher: And of course, they do break him. Let's discuss Room 101. What happens there and what does it represent?

Morgan: Room 101 contains "the worst thing in the world," which is different for everyone. For Winston, it's rats. When they threaten to release starving rats onto his face, he finally breaks completely and betrays Julia—"Do it to Julia! Not me!"—which is the one thing he'd sworn he wouldn't do. Room 101 represents the point where everyone breaks, where survival instinct overrides everything else, even love.

Teacher: That betrayal devastates Winston because it means the Party was right—there is no loyalty, no love, no bond that can't be broken under sufficient pressure. How did you feel about the ending?

Morgan: It's completely bleak. Winston doesn't die—that would almost be merciful. Instead, he's released as a broken shell who now genuinely loves Big Brother. He's been psychologically destroyed, and the worst part is he doesn't even know or care that he's been destroyed. He's happy in his degradation. It's one of the most depressing endings in literature.

Teacher: Why do you think Orwell chose such a hopeless ending rather than giving us even a glimmer of hope or resistance?

Morgan: To make the warning as stark as possible. If he'd had Winston die as a martyr or shown the Party eventually falling, readers might think "well, it turns out okay in the end." By having the Party win completely, by showing that totalitarianism can be so effective that it leaves no possibility of resistance, Orwell forces us to take the threat seriously. The message is: don't let it get to this point, because once it does, there's no escape.

Teacher: Excellent analysis. Let's discuss the novel's relevance today. You mentioned earlier that some aspects feel contemporary. What parallels do you see?

Morgan: Government surveillance is the obvious one. We carry smartphones that track our location, conversations, and behavior. Social media companies and governments collect massive amounts of data about us. While it's not as overt as telescreens, the surveillance capacity exists. There's also the manipulation of truth—"fake news," "alternative facts," politicians denying things there's video evidence of. The Party's claim that reality is whatever they say it is feels relevant when public figures brazenly lie and their supporters accept it.

Teacher: Those are common comparisons. Do you think they're fair, or is there a risk of overstating similarities?

Morgan: I think we should be careful about equating current problems with "1984" because that can trivialize genuine totalitarianism. What Winston experiences is orders of magnitude worse than anything happening in functioning democracies. At the same time, some authoritarian governments today do approach Orwellian levels—pervasive surveillance, thought control, rewriting history. And even in democracies, we should recognize warning signs like government overreach, surveillance expansion, and attacks on truth and press freedom. Orwell intended the novel as a warning, not a prediction, so the point is to recognize and resist these tendencies before they become entrenched.

Teacher: That's a balanced perspective. Let's talk about some of the novel's other themes. What role does sexuality play?

Morgan: The Party tries to suppress sexuality and pleasure because they're sources of loyalty and satisfaction outside Party control. If people form genuine intimate bonds, those bonds might compete with loyalty to Big Brother. If people experience pleasure, they might want more of it rather than accepting joyless sacrifice. Winston and Julia's affair is political precisely because it's motivated by pleasure and authentic connection rather than Party-sanctioned procreation. The Party wants to channel all energy and passion into adoration of Big Brother.

Teacher: Right—they want to eliminate the private sphere entirely. What about the proles? What role do they play?

Morgan: The proles—the working-class majority—are the only group with the numbers to potentially overthrow the Party. Winston has this theory that "if there is hope, it lies in the proles." But the proles are kept ignorant and distracted with entertainment, alcohol, and petty concerns. They don't have the consciousness or organization to rebel. There's a sad irony in the fact that the freest people in Oceania are the proles, because the Party doesn't bother controlling their minds—they're not considered dangerous.

Teacher: Yes, the Party monitors Party members obsessively but leaves proles relatively alone. It's a form of control through neglect. What did you think about the book within the book—Goldstein's "The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism"?

Morgan: It's interesting because it explains how the Party maintains power through perpetual war and the hierarchical class structure. Whether Goldstein is real or invented by the Party doesn't really matter—the analysis is accurate either way. The section explains that the three superstates maintain deliberately inconclusive warfare to consume resources and keep populations afraid and united against external enemies. It's "war is peace"—perpetual war enables internal control.

Teacher: And that manufactured threat becomes the justification for all the repression. Before we finish, what's your overall assessment of the novel's literary merit and importance?

Morgan: I think it's a masterpiece, even though it's almost unbearably bleak. Orwell's world-building is incredible—everything from Newspeak to the geography of London to the bureaucratic procedures feels completely realized. The ideas are profound and have influenced how we talk about authoritarianism—"Big Brother," "thoughtcrime," "doublethink," "Newspeak" have all entered common language. And the psychological insight into how totalitarian control works, how it breaks people down, is devastating but important.

As literature, it's maybe not as beautifully written as some novels—the prose is fairly straightforward and parts of Part Two drag a bit. But as a political and philosophical work disguised as fiction, it's essential. Everyone should read it, both to understand 20th century totalitarianism and to recognize warning signs for the future.

Teacher: That's a thoughtful assessment. The novel's power lies more in its ideas than its prose style, though the torture scenes are brutally effective writing. Morgan, you've demonstrated excellent comprehension of both the novel's plot and its deeper themes. Your ability to analyze the mechanisms of control, draw contemporary parallels while noting important differences, and engage with the philosophical questions Orwell raises shows sophisticated critical thinking.

Morgan: Thank you. This book really made me think about freedom, truth, and power in ways I hadn't before. It's disturbing but important.

Teacher: Exactly. The best literature should challenge us and make us think, even—or especially—when it's uncomfortable. Well done.
