Exploring Existentialism: Finding Meaning in an Uncertain World

Introduction

Adolescence is characterized by questioning—questioning authority, questioning societal norms, and perhaps most fundamentally, questioning the meaning and purpose of existence itself. These questions, far from being unique to teenagers or to our contemporary moment, have preoccupied philosophers throughout history. Existentialism, a philosophical movement that flourished in the mid-twentieth century but whose roots extend earlier and whose influence persists today, directly confronts these questions about meaning, freedom, authenticity, and what it means to live a genuinely human life. While existentialist philosophy can initially seem pessimistic or nihilistic, its core message is ultimately empowering: we are radically free to create meaning and define ourselves through our choices and actions, even—or especially—in a universe that provides no predetermined purpose or objective values.

Historical Context and Key Thinkers

While existentialist themes appear in earlier thinkers like Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, existentialism as a distinct movement emerged in twentieth-century Europe, particularly France, in response to the upheavals of two world wars, totalitarianism, and the perceived inadequacy of traditional philosophical systems to address the human condition. The movement's most prominent figures include Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, and Martin Heidegger, though these thinkers differed in their specific formulations and Camus explicitly rejected the existentialist label.

The historical context matters. Europe had experienced unprecedented destruction and moral horror through industrialized warfare, the Holocaust, and atomic weapons. Traditional authorities—religious, political, philosophical—seemed to have failed catastrophically. How could one believe in inherent human goodness or divine providence after Auschwitz? How could one maintain faith in reason and progress after World War I's senseless slaughter? Existentialism emerged from this crisis, attempting to construct a philosophy adequate to confronting an absurd world where traditional certainties had collapsed.

Core Existentialist Themes

Several interconnected themes define existentialist thought, though different philosophers emphasized different aspects. Understanding these themes provides a framework for exploring existentialism's insights and contemporary relevance.

**Existence Precedes Essence**

Sartre's famous formulation "existence precedes essence" captures a central existentialist claim. Traditional philosophy held that things have essential natures or essences that define what they are—a knife's essence is cutting, a chair's essence is sitting. For humans, this essentialist thinking suggested that human nature determines what we are and should be, whether defined by God, biology, or reason. Existentialism inverts this: humans first exist, then create their essence through choices and actions. We are not born with predetermined natures or purposes; we define ourselves through how we live.

This idea is simultaneously liberating and terrifying. Liberating because it means we're not constrained by fixed human nature, divine plans, or biological destiny. We possess radical freedom to choose who to become. Terrifying because this freedom entails responsibility—we cannot blame God, nature, or society for who we are. We must accept responsibility for our choices and their consequences. This freedom creates anxiety, what Sartre called "anguish," because we must choose without guaranteed outcomes or objective standards to guide us.

**Absurdity**

Albert Camus explored what he called "the Absurd"—the conflict between humans' deep need for meaning and the universe's apparent indifference to that need. We desperately want life to have purpose, for our actions to matter, for existence to make sense. Yet the universe offers no inherent meaning; it simply is, neither caring about our desires nor providing cosmic purposes. This disconnect between our need for meaning and the universe's meaninglessness constitutes absurdity.

Camus argued that recognizing absurdity leads to three possible responses: suicide (rejecting life because it's meaningless), philosophical suicide (embracing religious or ideological systems that deny absurdity by asserting transcendent meaning), or rebellion (accepting absurdity while choosing to live fully and create meaning despite it). Camus advocated the third path. In his essay "The Myth of Sisyphus," he imagines Sisyphus, condemned by the gods to eternally roll a boulder uphill only to watch it roll back down, as happy. Despite the futility of his task, Sisyphus can find meaning and satisfaction in the struggle itself, in his defiant persistence. "One must imagine Sisyphus happy," Camus concludes, suggesting that meaning comes not from achieving ultimate purposes but from embracing the present moment and the act of living.

**Authenticity and Bad Faith**

Existentialists distinguished between authentic and inauthentic existence. Authenticity means acknowledging one's freedom and responsibility, making genuine choices aligned with one's values rather than simply conforming to external expectations. Inauthenticity, what Sartre called "bad faith," means denying one's freedom by pretending to be determined by roles, social expectations, or circumstances beyond one's control.

A classic example: a waiter who completely identifies with his role, whose every gesture and word embodies "waiter-ness," is in bad faith. He's denying his freedom by acting as though being a waiter exhausts his identity, as though he has no choice but to perfectly perform this social role. Authenticity would mean serving customers while recognizing that "waiter" is a role he's chosen (even if pressured by economic necessity), not his essential identity, and that he retains freedom to reconsider his choices.

Bad faith is tempting because freedom is burdensome. It's easier to say "I had no choice" or "That's just how things are" than to accept responsibility for our decisions. Existentialism demands that we resist these comforting evasions and acknowledge our freedom even when doing so is uncomfortable.

**Anxiety, Dread, and Nausea**

Existentialist philosophers explored various moods or affective states that reveal fundamental truths about human existence. Heidegger discussed anxiety (Angst) as revealing the contingency of existence—the fact that we exist without reason or necessity, that nothingness is always possible. Unlike fear, which has a specific object (I fear the aggressive dog), anxiety has no particular object; it's a generalized unease about existence itself.

Sartre described nausea as the experience of confronting the sheer contingency and superfluity of existence. In his novel "Nausea," the protagonist Roquentin experiences a moment of existential revelation while looking at a tree root, suddenly perceiving its excessive, unjustified being. Everything exists without reason, without necessity—it's all gratuitous.

These descriptions might seem morbid, but existentialists viewed these experiences as important because they strip away comfortable illusions and force us to confront existence honestly. Only by acknowledging the groundlessness of existence can we achieve authenticity.

**Freedom and Responsibility**

Existentialism insists on human freedom, but this isn't a comforting political freedom or "freedom to do whatever I want." It's the ontological condition of being human—we are "condemned to be free," as Sartre put it. Even refusing to choose is a choice. Even acting under duress involves choosing how to respond to that duress.

This radical freedom entails radical responsibility. We cannot ultimately blame our actions on others, on society, on our upbringing, or on our circumstances. While these factors certainly influence us, we remain responsible for how we respond to them. This responsibility extends beyond ourselves. Sartre argued that when we choose, we choose for all humanity—our choices express our vision of what humans should be. This adds another dimension of responsibility and another source of anguish.

Applications and Contemporary Relevance

While existentialism as a distinct philosophical movement has waned, its themes remain profoundly relevant to contemporary concerns.

**Identity and Authenticity in the Digital Age**

Social media creates new pressures for inauthenticity. We curate online personas, performing identity for audiences, seeking validation through likes and followers. The existentialist challenge is to maintain authenticity despite these pressures—to make genuine choices about who we are rather than simply conforming to algorithmic incentives and social expectations. The existentialist would ask: Are you living authentically, or are you in bad faith, performing a role you think others expect?

**Meaning in a Secular Age**

As traditional religious frameworks lose influence in many societies, existentialism's approach to meaning-making becomes increasingly relevant. If we don't accept religious narratives about cosmic purpose, how do we find meaning? Existentialism offers an answer: we create meaning through our commitments, relationships, and projects. Meaning isn't something we discover in the universe; it's something we generate through how we live.

**Freedom and Determinism**

Contemporary debates about free will often frame the question in terms of neuroscience or physics—do our brains determine our actions? Is free will compatible with physical causation? Existentialism offers a different perspective, arguing that regardless of scientific questions about causation, we experience ourselves as free and must act from that experience. We cannot escape making choices and accepting responsibility for them. This experiential freedom is what matters for ethics and living.

**Anxiety and Mental Health**

Existential anxiety, the recognition of freedom and mortality, differs from clinical anxiety disorders, but existentialist insights inform therapeutic approaches. Existential psychotherapy, developed by figures like Irvin Yalom and Rollo May, applies existentialist themes to help people confront life's fundamental concerns—death, freedom, isolation, meaninglessness—and live more authentically. Rather than viewing anxiety as merely pathological, existential therapy recognizes that some anxiety is a natural response to the human condition.

**Absurdity and Nihilism**

Contemporary culture, particularly among young people, often expresses nihilistic themes—the sense that nothing matters, that existence is meaningless. Existentialism, particularly Camus's philosophy of the Absurd, offers a response. Yes, the universe is indifferent and life has no inherent meaning. But this realization, rather than leading to despair, can liberate us to create our own meaning. The absence of predetermined purpose is freedom, not condemnation.

Criticisms and Limitations

Existentialism has faced significant criticisms that are worth considering. Critics argue that its emphasis on individual freedom ignores social, economic, and historical constraints on actual choice. A person born into poverty with limited education doesn't have the same range of choices as someone born into privilege. To tell both that they're equally "condemned to be free" seems to ignore material realities.

Feminist philosophers, including existentialist Simone de Beauvoir, have noted that existentialism's account of freedom needs supplementation with analysis of how gender, race, and class constrain possibilities. De Beauvoir's "The Second Sex" applies existentialist concepts to analyze women's oppression, arguing that women have been denied the freedom to define themselves, instead being defined by and for men.

Some critics find existentialism excessively individualistic, neglecting the social and relational dimensions of human existence. We don't simply choose our identities in isolation; we're born into communities, cultures, and relationships that profoundly shape who we become. Existentialism's emphasis on individual choice may undervalue these communal dimensions.

Others argue that existentialism's rejection of objective values leads to troubling relativism. If we create our own values through choices, what prevents someone from choosing horrible values? Existentialists have various responses—Sartre argues that authenticity requires acknowledging others' freedom, Camus grounds ethics in solidarity and rebellion against injustice—but whether these responses adequately address the worry remains debated.

Conclusion

Existentialism emerged from historical crisis but speaks to perennial human concerns about meaning, freedom, authenticity, and mortality. Its central insights—that we create our essence through our choices, that the universe provides no inherent meaning but we can create meaning through how we live, that we must acknowledge our freedom and accept responsibility for our choices—remain powerfully relevant.

For adolescents and young adults wrestling with questions about identity, purpose, and how to live, existentialism offers both challenge and liberation. The challenge: you cannot escape freedom and responsibility by conforming to social expectations or blaming circumstances. You must make choices and accept their consequences. The liberation: you are not determined by your past, your biology, or others' expectations. You can choose who to become.

Existentialism demands that we live consciously and deliberately, that we question the roles and identities we've inherited, that we make authentic choices even when that's difficult. It insists that while life may be absurd and while we will die, we can nonetheless live fully and create meaning through our engagements, relationships, and commitments.

In our contemporary moment, characterized by rapid change, uncertain futures, and often superficial digital connections, existentialism's call to authenticity and meaning-making feels urgent. Rather than passively accepting algorithmic recommendations, social media performances, or consumerist definitions of success, we can actively choose what matters to us and commit to living according to those choices.

Existentialism won't provide comfortable answers or guaranteed purposes. It won't tell you what to believe or how to live. Instead, it insists that these are questions you must answer for yourself through your choices and actions. This is simultaneously the burden and the possibility of human existence: we are condemned to be free, and in that freedom lies our humanity.
